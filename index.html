     <h1>Introduction</h1>
     <p>I like to think that I am hard working and an outspoken person. I work fairly well with others towards a common goal. I try to be a leader rather than a follower. I also love coffee.</p>
     <p>Family, friends, and food are among many things that are important to me.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="location-section">
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from a small town called Atascadero in the Central Coast of California. It's one of those towns where you are very likely to run into someone you know at the grocery store. Not many activities to do but it's a wonderful town with wonderful people.</p>

      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p>I enjoy photography, filming and editing video, sound mixing, light designing, graphic design, gaming, and coding (of course!).</p>
      <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
      <p> My dream job would be to work for myself and start my own company. I have a dream of building an app that is a part of peoples' daily lives. I would love to opportunity to work with amazing people that are creative problem solvers. Those are the people
      who will make a difference in the world.</p>
      <h2>What is you favorite show to binge watch on Netflix?</h2>
      <p>I cannot choose between "The Office", Marvel's "DareDevil", or "How I met your Mother". Those are my favorite TV shows of all time. I would binge watch them any time.</p>
      <h2>Are you team Cap or team Iron Man for Captain America: Civil War?</h2>
      <p>This is probably the toughest decision I have had to make in a while. I love both heroes but I think I would lean more towards team Iron Man. You know, because it's Iron Man.</p>
